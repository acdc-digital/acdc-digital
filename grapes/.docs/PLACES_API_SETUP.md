# Google Places API Setup Guide

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Code is implemented and ready
- ‚úÖ `search_places` action exists in the tool
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to enable Places API in Google Cloud Console

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Enable Places API
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library

Search for and enable **both**:
- **Places API** (legacy - currently used)
- **Places API (New)** (recommended for future)

### 2. Verify API Key Permissions
Your current API key needs these permissions:
- ‚úÖ Maps JavaScript API (already working)
- ‚úÖ Geocoding API (already working)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Places API (needs to be enabled)

### 3. Test the Feature

Once enabled, try these queries:

**Example 1: Find restaurants**
```
Draw a shape over downtown Winnipeg, then ask:
"Find restaurants in this area"
```

**Example 2: Find hotels**
```
Draw a shape over any city, then ask:
"Show me hotels in this region"
```

**Example 3: Find coffee shops**
```
Draw a shape and ask:
"Find coffee shops nearby"
```

## How It Works

1. **User draws shape** ‚Üí System calculates center point + radius
2. **Claude uses google_maps_api tool** with `action: "search_places"`
3. **API returns** business list with names, addresses, ratings
4. **User sees results** in chat interface

## API Call Parameters

The system automatically converts your drawn shape to:
- **center**: `{ lat, lng }` - calculated from polygon center
- **radius**: meters (calculated from polygon size)
- **type**: restaurant, cafe, hotel, store, gas_station, etc.
- **keyword**: optional search term

## Business Data Returned

Each result includes:
- ‚úÖ Name
- ‚úÖ Address
- ‚úÖ Rating (1-5 stars)
- ‚úÖ Number of reviews
- ‚úÖ Place types
- ‚úÖ Coordinates
- ‚úÖ Opening hours (if available)
- ‚úÖ Price level (if available)

## Cost Estimate

Google Places API pricing:
- **Nearby Search**: $32 per 1000 requests
- **Each request**: returns up to 20 results
- **Your usage**: Likely 1-10 requests/day in testing

Example: 100 searches = $3.20

## Alternative: Text Search

If you want more flexible queries, we can also add:
```typescript
action: "text_search_places"
query: "best pizza restaurants in downtown"
```

This uses natural language instead of coordinates.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Enable Places API in Cloud Console (2 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ Test with "Find restaurants in this area"
3. ‚úÖ See real business data appear in chat
4. üéØ Build UI to display results nicely (cards, maps, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "REQUEST_DENIED"**
- Solution: Enable Places API in console

**Error: "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT"**
- Solution: Check billing is enabled

**Error: "ZERO_RESULTS"**
- Solution: Area might be too remote, try larger city

**Results seem wrong**
- Remember: Coordinates are ~90% accurate (40-100km offset)
- Solution: Draw larger shapes, use vision for precise targeting
