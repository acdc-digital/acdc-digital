To reach niche audiences on Reddit, first identify target subreddits 
<mark>and understand each community’s rules.</mark>

Use Reddit’s search and related-links to uncover relevant forums – for example, tools like GummySearch can map related communities (e.g. r/analytics connects to r/dataanalysis and r/marketing ￼).  Complete your Reddit profile (including social links) and build some karma before posting, since many subs enforce a minimum karma and custom rules ￼.  Align content with audience: focus on subs that match your niche interests (e.g. analytics, media, marketing) ￼ ￼, and always check each sub’s sidebar/rules (some ban frequent self-promotion ￼ ￼).  Engage authentically – comment and help, don’t just blast ads.
