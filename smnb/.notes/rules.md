1. I don't like to set heights in line, unless it's an absolute component. But a dashboard component that doesn't need a set size, or that needs to be more flexible should always use a flex layout for optimal performance.

// COMPONENT NAME
// COMPONENT_PATH

ie, 
// COPILOT NOTES RULES
// /Users/matthewsimon/Projects/SMNB/.notes/rules.md
