# Content Requirement Fix & Auto-Recovery

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Issue:** "Cannot start broadcast: state is 'error', not 'ready', no content available"

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Content Requirement Removed**

**Problem:**  
The orchestrator was checking `liveFeedStore.posts.length === 0` before allowing broadcast to start. This is backwards - **the broadcast's job is to fetch and aggregate content**, not require it to already exist!

**Solution:**  
Removed the content availability check from `canStartBroadcast()`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
if (liveFeedStore.posts.length === 0) {
  return false; // ❌ Can't start without content
}

// AFTER (Correct)
// Note: We don't check for content availability because
// the broadcast's job is to FETCH and aggregate content.
// The live feed will populate as the broadcast runs.
return true; // ✅ Can start, will fetch content
```

**File Changed:** `/lib/stores/orchestrator/broadcastOrchestrator.ts`

---

### 2. **Auto-Recovery from Error State**

**Problem:**  
When the orchestrator is in 'error' state, clicking "Go Live" does nothing because `canStartBroadcast()` requires state to be 'ready'.

**Solution:**  
Added automatic recovery in the Sessions component. When user clicks "Go Live" while in error state:

1. Automatically calls `recover()` to clean up and re-initialize
2. Returns orchestrator to 'ready' state
3. Proceeds to start broadcast

**Code Added:**

```typescript
const handleToggleLive = async () => {
  if (isLive) {
    await stopBroadcast();
  } else {
    // Check if in error state - auto-recover first
    if (broadcastState === 'error') {
      console.log('📺 SESSIONS: Error state detected, attempting recovery...');
      await recover();
      // After recovery, the state should be 'ready', so fall through to start
    }
    
    await startBroadcast(selectedSessionId ?? undefined);
  }
};
```

**File Changed:** `/app/dashboard/studio/sessions/Sessions.tsx`

---

### 3. **Visual Error State Indicator**

**Enhancement:**  
Button now shows different states:

- **Normal:** "Go Live" (gray button)
- **Live:** "LIVE" (red button with pulse animation)
- **Error:** "⚠️ Recover & Start" (yellow button)
- **Transitioning:** Loading spinner with "Starting..." or "Stopping..."

**CSS Classes:**
```tsx
className={`h-7 gap-1.5 ${
  isBroadcasting
    ? "bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white"
    : broadcastState === 'error'
      ? "bg-yellow-600 hover:bg-yellow-700 text-white border-yellow-500"
      : "bg-neutral-900 border-neutral-700 text-neutral-400 hover:bg-neutral-800 hover:text-white"
}`}
```

**File Changed:** `/app/dashboard/studio/sessions/Sessions.tsx`

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Normal Flow (No Error):
```
User clicks "Go Live"
  ↓
Check: broadcastState === 'ready' ✅
  ↓
Start broadcast sequence
  ↓
Fetch content from live feed dynamically
  ↓
State: ready → starting → live
```

### Recovery Flow (Error State):
```
User clicks "⚠️ Recover & Start"
  ↓
Detect: broadcastState === 'error'
  ↓
Auto-recovery:
  1. Stop all active services
  2. Clear error
  3. Return to 'idle' state
  4. Re-initialize → 'ready' state
  ↓
Start broadcast sequence
  ↓
Fetch content from live feed dynamically
  ↓
State: error → idle → initializing → ready → starting → live
```

## 📝 Key Changes Summary

| Component | Change | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `broadcastOrchestrator.ts` | Removed content requirement | Broadcast **aggregates** content, doesn't require it upfront |
| `Sessions.tsx` | Added auto-recovery on error | User shouldn't need to manually recover |
| `Sessions.tsx` | Added visual error state | Clear feedback when system needs recovery |

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Normal Broadcast Start
1. Open Sessions tab
2. Click "Go Live"
3. **Expected:** Broadcast starts, live feed begins aggregating content
4. **Verify:** State Monitor shows `live`, posts appear in feed

### Test 2: Recovery from Error
1. If State Monitor shows `error` state
2. Click "⚠️ Recover & Start" button (yellow)
3. **Expected:** 
   - Console logs: "Error state detected, attempting recovery..."
   - Button shows loading spinner
   - State transitions: error → idle → initializing → ready → starting → live
4. **Verify:** Broadcast starts successfully

### Test 3: Content Aggregation
1. Start broadcast with empty live feed
2. **Expected:** Broadcast starts successfully (doesn't wait for content)
3. Live feed populates as broadcast runs
4. Host agent processes posts as they arrive
5. **Verify:** Narrations generate from dynamically fetched posts

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Orchestrator State Machine
```
idle → initializing → ready → starting → live → stopping → idle
  ↓                      ↑                 ↓
  error ────────────────┘                 error
```

### Recovery Process
```typescript
async recover() {
  // 1. Stop all services
  await emergencyStop();
  
  // 2. Clear error
  _clearError();
  _setState('idle', 'error_rollback');
  
  // 3. Re-initialize
  if (enableAutoRecovery) {
    await initialize();
  }
}
```

## ✅ Result

**The Session Manager now:**
- ✅ Starts broadcast without requiring pre-existing content
- ✅ Automatically recovers from error states
- ✅ Provides clear visual feedback for errors
- ✅ Aggregates content dynamically during broadcast
- ✅ Handles the full broadcast lifecycle correctly

**Ready for testing!** 🎉
