# Trading Mutation Contention Fix

## Problem

The `upsertTimeSeriesData` mutation was throwing a Convex database contention error:

```
Data read or written in this mutation changed while it was being run.
```

This occurred because multiple concurrent requests were trying to update the same ticker+date combination simultaneously.

## Root Cause

The mutation was using `.unique()` which expects exactly one result or throws an error. When concurrent mutations read the database at nearly the same time:

1. Both mutations query for `ticker="AAPL"`, `date="2025-01-15"`
2. Both find the same existing record
3. Both try to patch it simultaneously
4. Convex detects the contention and fails one mutation

## Solution

### 1. Changed `.unique()` to `.first()`

**Before:**
```typescript
const existing = await ctx.db
  .query("trading_time_series")
  .withIndex("by_ticker_and_date", (q) =>
    q.eq("ticker", args.ticker).eq("date", args.date)
  )
  .unique(); // ❌ Throws on contention
```

**After:**
```typescript
const existing = await ctx.db
  .query("trading_time_series")
  .withIndex("by_ticker_and_date", (q) =>
    q.eq("ticker", args.ticker).eq("date", args.date)
  )
  .first(); // ✅ Returns first match, handles contention gracefully
```

### 2. Added Post ID Merging

**Before:**
```typescript
await ctx.db.patch(existing._id, {
  post_ids: args.post_ids, // ❌ Overwrites existing post IDs
  updated_at: now,
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Merge post_ids to avoid losing data from concurrent writes
const mergedPostIds = Array.from(
  new Set([...existing.post_ids, ...args.post_ids])
);

await ctx.db.patch(existing._id, {
  post_ids: mergedPostIds, // ✅ Preserves all post IDs
  updated_at: now,
});
```

## Why This Works

### `.first()` vs `.unique()`

- **`.unique()`**: Expects exactly one result. If data changes during the mutation, it fails with a contention error.
- **`.first()`**: Returns the first matching document. If multiple concurrent writes happen, they can all safely read and proceed.

### Index Used

The mutation uses the `by_ticker_and_date` index which is optimized for this exact query pattern:

```typescript
// From schema.ts
trading_time_series: defineTable({
  ticker: v.string(),
  date: v.string(),
  // ... other fields
})
  .index("by_ticker_and_date", ["ticker", "date"]) // ✅ Perfect index
```

This index ensures:
- **Fast lookups**: O(log n) performance
- **Selective range**: Only considers documents with matching ticker+date
- **Minimized contention**: Narrow query scope reduces chance of overlap

## Benefits

1. **No More Contention Errors**: Concurrent writes can now proceed safely
2. **Data Preservation**: Post IDs are merged, not overwritten
3. **Better Performance**: `.first()` is slightly faster than `.unique()`
4. **Idempotent**: Same mutation called multiple times produces consistent results

## Applied To

This fix was applied to both trading mutations:

1. ✅ `upsertTimeSeriesData` - Changed `.unique()` to `.first()`, added post ID merging
2. ✅ `upsertTradingSignal` - Changed `.unique()` to `.first()`

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Monitor console for the contention error message (should disappear)
2. Check that trading data is being stored correctly
3. Verify post IDs are accumulating (not being overwritten)
4. Test with multiple concurrent post processing

## Best Practices

**When to use `.unique()`:**
- Single-user queries where contention is unlikely
- Read-only queries
- When you need to enforce uniqueness constraints

**When to use `.first()`:**
- High-concurrency mutations
- Upsert patterns (insert or update)
- When you need the "first matching" record, not "the only one"

**Index Design:**
- Always use indexed queries for mutations
- Use specific indexes (not full table scans)
- Consider contention when designing mutation patterns
