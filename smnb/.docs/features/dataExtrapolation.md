## Metric Scoring Matrix

**The following matrix provides a framework to evaluate subreddit and content sources for engagement within a pre-determined audience. Each metric captures a different aspect of content value: efficiency, relevance, engagement, novelty, propagation, and stability. Metrics are normalized to a 0–100 score and weighted by a confidence factor based on sample size, ensuring reliability. Higher scores indicate stronger predictors of meaningful, actionable content. This matrix can be used to rank subreddits, identify high-value content, and guide social content strategy.**

| Metric Name              | Definition                                                                 | Formula                                                                                                         | Interpretation                                                                 | Example / Source Reference                                                                 | Score (0–100) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Story Yield (SY)**     | Efficiency of turning posts into usable stories                           | $\mathrm{SY} = \dfrac{\text{Stories Extracted}}{\text{Posts Collected}}$                                        | Core "signal vs noise" measure. Higher = more efficient content source.       | r/MentalHealth (11→9, SY = 81.8%) vs r/Notion (4→0, SY = 0%).                             | 78            |
| **Feed Contribution (FC)** | Proportion of feed items from this source relative to total feed         | $\mathrm{FC} = \dfrac{\text{Feed Items from Source}}{\text{Total Feed Items}}$                                  | How much this source contributes to the overall feed.                          | r/GetDisciplined contributed ~25 feed items out of 377 total feed items → FC ≈ 7%.         | 7             |
| **Engagement Potential (EP)** | Average engagement of posts that successfully became stories           | $\mathrm{EP} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathrm{EngagementScore}_{i}}{N}$ where $N$ = Number of Stories           | Quality metric: shows whether story posts are resonating (likes, comments, score). | r/Entrepreneur had high-scoring story posts (high EP) vs r/Journaling (no stories, EP N/A). | 95            |
| **Relevance Consistency (RC)** | Share of extracted stories aligned with Soloist’s core themes        | $\mathrm{RC} = \dfrac{\text{Relevant Stories}}{\text{Total Stories}}$                                           | Measures thematic alignment with Soloist (habit, mood, productivity, therapy). | r/Zettelkasten (4 relevant / 5 total → RC = 80%) vs r/AppHookup (1/6 → RC ≈ 16.7%).       | 57            |
| **Novelty Index (NI)**   | Proportion of unique, non-repeated concepts contributed by a source      | $\mathrm{NI} = \dfrac{\text{Unique Concepts or Stories}}{\text{Total Stories}}$                                  | How often the source introduces new insights vs repeats.                       | r/Therapy produced an "AI-assisted journaling" story (NI high) vs repetitive habit tips (NI low). | 42            |
| **Trend Propagation (TP)** | Extent to which stories from a source appear across multiple communities | $\mathrm{TP} = \dfrac{\text{Cross-posted or Shared Stories}}{\text{Total Stories from Source}}$                  | Detects whether a sub seeds discussions beyond itself.                         | "Small wins journaling" from r/MentalHealth also seen in r/DecidingToBeBetter → TP > 0.    | 16            |
| **Volume Reliability (VR)** | Stability of post inflow from this community over time                 | $\mathrm{VR} = \dfrac{\text{Posts Collected in Period}}{\text{Period Length}}$                                   | Ensures you’re not optimizing around short-lived spikes (posts per time unit). | r/Evernote ≈ 8 posts/day (stable) vs r/ZenHabits ≈ 1/week (low VR).                       | 71            |
| **Signal Density (SD)**  | Stories produced per 1k tokens consumed                                  | $\mathrm{SD} = \dfrac{\text{Stories Extracted}}{\text{Tokens Consumed}/1000}$                                   | Efficiency: how many useful stories per compute/token cost.                    | r/Zettelkasten: 5 stories / 6k tokens → SD ≈ 0.83 vs r/Notion = 0.00.                       | 59            |
| **Conversion Momentum (CM)** | Change in story yield across time slices (rate of change in SY)      | $\mathrm{CM} = \dfrac{\mathrm{SY}_{t} - \mathrm{SY}_{t-1}}{\Delta t}$                                            | Measures whether a sub’s usefulness is increasing or declining.               | r/Therapy improved from SY 40% → 70% over two weeks → positive CM.                        | 57            |
