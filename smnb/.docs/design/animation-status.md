# Animation Implementation Status

## ❌ Framer Motion Issues
- TypeScript compatibility issues with React 19
- Motion component typing conflicts
- Version mismatch errors preventing compilation

## ✅ Alternative Solution: CSS Animations
Implementing smooth animations using pure CSS with Tailwind utilities instead of Framer Motion.

## Recommended Approach
1. Use CSS keyframes for smooth animations
2. Apply Tailwind animation classes
3. Maintain performance with transform properties
4. Respect reduced motion preferences

## Next Steps
- Implement CSS-based animation solution
- Add smooth slide-in effects for new posts
- Include hover animations for interactive elements
- Test performance and accessibility
