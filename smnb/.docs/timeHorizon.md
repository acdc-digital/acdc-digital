## TIME HORIZON MARKETING

the point of the time horizon is so that agencies can leverage them while they’re still culturally relevant.

Short Term: Explosive content is generated, usually spikes gaining relevance but fades quickly because it lacks substance.

#### Probability for accuracy of synthetic data
You can think of it probabilistically:
P(\text{Synthetic Content Matches Real Trends}) = P(\text{Seed Trend is Real}) \times P(\text{LLM Generalization is Accurate})

	•	If your seed detection is ~70% accurate (strong signals), and LLM generalization is ~80% accurate (good at extrapolating), then overall ≈ 56% chance that scaled-up synthetic narratives reflect reality.
	•	With weaker detection, this drops fast.
