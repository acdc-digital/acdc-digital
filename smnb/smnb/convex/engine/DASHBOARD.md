# Engine Dashboard - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Built

### 1. New Dashboard Tab: **Engine**
- **Location**: `/app/dashboard/studio/engine/Engine.tsx`
- **Icon**: `DatabaseZap` from lucide-react
- **Position**: 4th item in activity bar (after Home, before Heatmap)

### 2. Dashboard Features

#### Health Status Card
Displays real-time Engine health:
- **Status**: healthy / degraded / error
- **Processing Lag**: Milliseconds behind real-time
- **Events Pending**: Unprocessed events waiting
- **Last Run**: Last processing cycle timestamp

Color-coded:
- üü¢ Green: Healthy (lag < 10s)
- üü° Yellow: Degraded (lag 10-60s)
- üî¥ Red: Error (lag > 60s or initialization needed)

#### Four Core Metric Cards

**RC - Relevance Consistency**
- Theme alignment percentage
- Shows how well stories align with their themes
- Blue card with TrendingUp icon

**NI - Novelty Index**
- Count of unique concepts discovered
- Measures content diversity and novelty
- Purple card with Zap icon

**TP - Trend Propagation**
- Cross-post story rate percentage
- Tracks how trends spread across posts
- Green card with Activity icon

**CM - Conversion Momentum**
- Story yield change rate
- Measures conversion velocity (positive/negative)
- Dynamic color: green for positive, red for negative

#### Timeline View
Shows historical metrics in reverse chronological order:
- All 4 metrics displayed per time bucket
- Story yield for each period
- Timestamps for temporal context

### 3. Navigation Integration

**Activity Bar** (`/app/dashboard/activityBar/ActivityBar.tsx`)
- Added `DatabaseZap` icon import
- Added `"engine"` to `PanelType` union
- Inserted Engine button between Home and Heatmap

**Dashboard Layout** (`/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)
- Imported Engine component
- Added Engine panel div with visibility toggle
- Integrated with existing panel switching system

## How to Use

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Open your SMNB app at `/dashboard`
2. Look for the **‚ö° Database-Zap icon** in the left activity bar (4th item)
3. Click it to open the Engine metrics dashboard

### What You'll See

**Before Engine Initialization:**
- Health Status: üî¥ Error
- Message: "Engine Not Initialized"
- Command snippet to run initialization

**After Initialization:**
- Health Status: üü¢ Healthy
- Live metrics updating every ~10 seconds
- Real-time processing lag and event counts
- Timeline showing metric evolution

### Current State

#### ‚úÖ Implemented
- Full dashboard UI with all 4 metrics
- Health monitoring display
- Timeline view
- Activity bar integration
- Panel navigation

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Waiting for Initialization
The Engine is **deployed** but not yet **running**. You need to:

```typescript
// Run once to start the Engine
import { api } from "@/convex/_generated/api";
await convexClient.action(api.engine.setup.setupEngine, {});
```

This will:
1. Create the initial watermark
2. Start the scheduled processing loop (runs every 10s)
3. Begin processing events from story creation and post ingestion

#### üé® Ready to Enhance
Once initialized, you can:
- Add chart visualizations for timeseries data
- Create per-session/subreddit metric views
- Add filtering and date range selectors
- Build alert widgets for unhealthy states
- Export metrics for reporting

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
Story Created ‚Üí emitStoryCreated ‚Üí enrichment_events
Post Ingested ‚Üí emitPostEnriched ‚Üí enrichment_events
                      ‚Üì
            applyEvents (every 10s)
                      ‚Üì
                stat_buckets
                      ‚Üì
              getMetrics query
                      ‚Üì
             Engine Dashboard UI
```

### Real-time Updates
- Uses Convex `useQuery` hooks
- Automatically updates when data changes
- No manual refresh needed
- ~10 second latency for new metrics

### Performance
- Queries are indexed for fast reads
- Pre-aggregated buckets (O(bucket_count) not O(events))
- Minimal impact on UI rendering
- Scales with time windows, not event volume

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize Engine** - Run setup to start processing
2. **Test with Data** - Create stories and ingest posts to see metrics
3. **Monitor Health** - Watch the lag and pending counts
4. **Enhance UI** - Add charts, filters, and visualizations
5. **Production Ready** - Set up alerting for unhealthy states

The Engine dashboard is **ready to use** as soon as you initialize the Engine! üî•
