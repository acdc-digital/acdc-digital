## Agent Integration Points

### 1. **Convex Database**

- Agents persist artifacts (files, posts, scheduling updates) via scoped mutations
- Chat-centric operations persist messages with roles: `user`, `assistant`, `thinking`, `system`, `terminal`
- Real-time reactivity for immediate UI updates

### 2. **File System**

- File & post creation flows route through editor store then Convex for durable storage
- Standardized naming & extension handling with slug normalization
- Template system for different file types

### 3. **AI Context**

- Instructions automatically added to chat context
- Agents can access project history
- Context-aware responses and suggestions
- Token tracking and cost management

### 4. **Editor Integration**

- Generated files open in tabbed editor
- Syntax highlighting and formatting
- Live preview capabilities
- Multi-file editing support

### 5. **Content Calendar Integration**

- Scheduler + post agents emit updates reflected in calendar UI without manual refresh
- Color & icon semantics derived from platform metadata
- Real-time collaboration features

## Technical Specifications

### Agent Interface

```typescript
interface AgentTool {
  command: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  usage?: string;
  examples?: string[];
}

interface AgentExecutionContext {
  sessionId?: string;
  userId?: string | Id<"users">;
  projectId?: Id<"projects">;
}

interface AgentExecutionResult {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;
  requiresUserInput?: boolean;
  interactiveComponent?: {
    type: string;
    data?: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
}

abstract class BaseAgent {
  abstract readonly id: string;
  abstract readonly name: string;
  abstract readonly description: string;
  abstract readonly icon: string;
  abstract readonly isPremium: boolean;
  abstract readonly tools: AgentTool[];
  
  abstract execute(
    tool: AgentTool,
    input: string,
    mutations: ConvexMutations,
    context?: AgentExecutionContext
  ): Promise<AgentExecutionResult>;
}
```

### Performance Notes

- Registry initialization logs each agent; console logs are gated in production
- Command dispatch is O(n) over registered tools (acceptable at current scale)
- Real-time database operations with optimistic updates
- Efficient indexing for fast data retrieval

---

## Security & Privacy

- **User Isolation**: Each user's agents and data are completely isolated
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control with premium features
- **Data Encryption**: All database communications encrypted
- **Audit Trail**: Full execution history maintained
- **Premium Access Control**: Subscription-based feature gating

---

## State Management Architecture

Following AURA's state management principles:

### Server State (Convex) = Source of Truth
- All persistent data (projects, files, posts, user data)
- Real-time synchronization across clients
- ACID transactions for data integrity

### Client State (Zustand) = UI-only concerns
- Agent activation states
- UI panel visibility
- Terminal interaction state
- Temporary form data

### Component State (useState) = Ephemeral UI state
- Modal visibility
- Loading states
- Form inputs (before submission)

---

## Future Roadmap

Planned / Proposed:

- **Reddit Agent**: Platform parity & cross-posting capabilities
- **Analytics Agent**: Engagement & performance aggregation
- **SEO Agent**: Content scoring & optimization recommendations
- **Campaign Director**: Multi-platform sequencing and orchestration
- **Code Generation Agent**: Development workflow automation

Enhancement Tracks:

- Visual workflow composer for agent chains
- User-defined custom agents (configurable tool chains)
- Pluggable validation schemas for tool parameters
- Multi-agent collaborative sessions & tool handoff
- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboard

---

## Best Practices

1. **Activate only needed agents** to reduce UI clutter and improve performance
2. **Use descriptive parameters** for better results and clearer execution
3. **Check execution history** for debugging and optimization
4. **Combine agents** for complex workflows and automation
5. **Provide clear instructions** for context-aware AI assistance
6. **Monitor premium usage** for cost management
7. **Follow state separation rules** when extending agent functionality

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                     | Solution                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent not appearing       | Check `registry.ts` initialization & browser console logs            |
| Command not working       | Confirm leading slash and that tool command matches registry         |
| File not created          | Check project permissions, folder structure, and Convex connectivity |
| Context not applied       | Verify Instructions project exists in database                       |
| Stuck in file creation    | Provide required file name / select project via interactive component|
| Premium agent unavailable | Verify subscription status and user permissions                      |
| Performance issues        | Check network connectivity and Convex status                         |
