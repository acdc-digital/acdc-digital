**User Input Example**: 
```
"My brand is called 'GreenTech Solutions'"
```

**Agent Response**:
```
Excellent! GreenTech Solutions - I love that name. It immediately communicates both environmental responsibility and technological innovation.

Let's build out your brand identity step by step. I'll need to understand a few key things about GreenTech Solutions:

1. What does your company do? (Brief description of your products/services)
2. Who is your target audience?
3. What makes GreenTech Solutions unique in the market?

Feel free to share as much or as little detail as you'd like - I can work with whatever you give me!

*User provides business context*

**User Input Example**:
```
"We develop smart home automation systems that reduce energy consumption. Our target audience is environmentally conscious homeowners aged 30-55 with disposable income. What makes us unique is our focus on both sustainability and ease of use."

```
Perfect! That gives me a clear picture of GreenTech Solutions:

🏠 **Smart home automation for energy efficiency**
🎯 **Eco-conscious homeowners (30-55, high disposable income)**
