**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Prepared for:** Soloist Marketing Team

## Executive Summary

This document serves as the definitive reference for all Soloist marketing and creative work. It ensures brand consistency across social media, email campaigns, and all external communications as we prepare for public launch.

Soloist is a personal wellness product that transforms daily reflection into visual rhythm. Our brand exists at the intersection of data and humanity—we celebrate the individual journey while providing the structure needed for meaningful self-improvement.

**Core Value Proposition:** Soloist helps individuals track, understand, and improve their daily emotional wellbeing through AI-powered insights and intuitive data visualization.

## Part I: Brand Foundation

### Brand Philosophy

Soloist represents the **individual journey**—the pursuit of progress, the rhythm of effort, and the quiet rebellion of standing apart in a world that measures everything.

#### The Four Pillars

| Pillar | Definition | Marketing Application |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| **Individuality** | The power of one. Celebrating the singular journey. | Speak to "you," never "users." Personal stories. |
| **Persistence** | Daily struggle toward progress. Consistent effort. | Emphasize streaks, daily habits, small wins. |
| **Contrast** | Standing out amid systems and structure. | Differentiate from clinical/corporate wellness apps. |
| **Balance** | Between chaos and control, system and self. | Blend data precision with human warmth. |

### Brand Personality

**We are:**
- Reflective, not preachy
- Empowering, not prescriptive  
- Data-aware, not data-obsessed
- Human, not robotic
- Confident, not arrogant
- Accessible, not dumbed-down

**We are NOT:**
- A clinical mental health app
- A productivity grindset tool
- A social comparison platform
- A gamified dopamine trap

---

## Part II: Visual Identity

### Primary Logo Mark

The Soloist logo features a **circle** (representing wholeness, time, and environment) containing the **Solo Dot**—a small, vibrant element representing the individual within their ecosystem.

**Visual Metaphor:** One person navigating systems larger than themselves—struggling, growing, and defining their own rhythm.

### Product Identity System

Soloist uses a three-color identity system across its product ecosystem:

| Context | Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Website** | Black | `#171717` | Marketing site, documentation, wiki |
| **Application** | Blue | `#0141E4` | Desktop app, in-product experience |
| **Marketing** | Red | `#FF0000` | Promotional campaigns, social media accents |

### Core Color Palette

#### Primary Colors

| Name | Hex | RGB | Usage |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| Solo Red | `#EF4444` | 239, 68, 68 | Brand accent, CTAs, emphasis |
| Neutral 900 | `#171717` | 23, 23, 23 | Dark backgrounds, text |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | 255, 255, 255 | Light backgrounds, contrast |
| Background Light | `#f9f9f9` | 249, 249, 249 | Warm gray foundations |

#### Secondary Colors

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| Neutral 800 | `#262626` | UI surfaces, shadows |
| Neutral 700 | `#404040` | Borders, secondary elements |
| App Blue | `#0141E4` | Application context |
| Marketing Red | `#FF0000` | Promotional materials |

#### Semantic Colors

| Purpose | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Success/Positive | Emerald | `#059669` |
| Warning/Caution | Amber | `#F59E0B` |
| Error/Negative | Rose | `#E11D48` |
| Primary Action | Blue | `#3B82F6` |

### Heatmap Color Spectrum

The signature Soloist heatmap uses a 10-tier color spectrum. This is central to our visual identity and should be referenced in data visualizations:

```
Score 90-100: Indigo   (#818CF8) — Excellent
Score 80-89:  Blue     (#60A5FA) — Great  
Score 70-79:  Sky      (#38BDF8) — Good
Score 60-69:  Teal     (#2DD4BF) — Above Average
Score 50-59:  Green    (#4ADE80) — Average
Score 40-49:  Lime     (#A3E635) — Below Average
Score 30-39:  Yellow   (#FACC15) — Low
Score 20-29:  Amber    (#F59E0B) — Very Low
Score 10-19:  Orange   (#F97316) — Poor
Score 0-9:    Rose     (#E11D48) — Critical
```

### Typography

#### Font Families

| Purpose | Font | Weights | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| **Headings/Brand** | Parkinsans | 300, 400, 600, 800 | Modern, geometric, confident |
| **Body** | Architects Daughter | 400 | Friendly, handwritten feel |
| **UI/Functional** | Inter | 400, 500, 600 | Clean, readable |
| **Fallback** | System fonts | — | -apple-system, SF Pro, etc. |

#### Typography Principles

- **Tracking:** Use `-0.02em` for display text
- **Hierarchy:** Calm structure, minimal uppercase
- **Breathing room:** Generous line heights (1.5-1.75 for body)
- **Responsive:** Use fluid typography with `clamp()` where possible

### Visual Treatments

#### Signature Elements

1. **Asymmetric Corners**
   - Pattern: `rounded-tl-none rounded-tr-xl rounded-b-xl`
   - Creates a "tab" aesthetic suggesting documents/cards
   - Use for content cards, feature highlights

2. **Glass Effects**
   - `backdrop-filter: blur(16px) saturate(160%)`
   - Premium feel for navigation, elevated surfaces
   - Use sparingly for important UI elements

3. **Warm Tints**
   - `bg-yellow-50/10` (10% cream)
   - Adds psychological warmth to content
   - Use for cards containing personal/emotional content

4. **Trend Badges**
   - Compact colored squares with directional arrows
   - Green (↑), Red (↓), Gray (→)
   - Use for showing score changes

## Part III: Brand Voice & Messaging

### Voice Characteristics

| Trait | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Reflective** | We encourage thinking, not just doing | "What patterns do you notice?" |
| **Empowering** | We give agency, not commands | "Your data reveals..." not "You should..." |
| **Data-aware** | We respect the numbers | "Your 7-day average suggests..." |
| **Human** | We acknowledge the person behind the data | "Some days are harder than others." |

### Messaging Framework

#### Core Messages

**Primary Tagline:**
> "Progress has rhythm."

**Secondary Taglines:**
> "Your data, your rhythm."  
> "Every day is data. Every reflection is progress."

#### Value Propositions by Audience

| Audience | Pain Point | Our Message |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Self-improvement seekers | Overwhelmed by apps that don't stick | "One score. Daily insight. No overwhelm." |
| Data-driven individuals | Want metrics without clinical coldness | "Your emotional data, visualized beautifully." |
| Busy professionals | No time for journaling | "30 seconds to log. Lifetime of insight." |
| Mental wellness curious | Skeptical of therapy apps | "Not therapy. Just clarity." |

### Writing Guidelines

#### Do's

- ✓ Speak directly to "you" (singular, personal)
- ✓ Use active voice
- ✓ Acknowledge the difficulty of self-improvement
- ✓ Reference specific features (Heatmap, AI forecasts)
- ✓ Celebrate small wins
- ✓ Use metaphors about rhythm, patterns, journeys

#### Don'ts

- ✗ Make clinical promises ("cure," "treatment," "diagnose")
- ✗ Use hustle culture language ("grind," "crush it," "10x")
- ✗ Compare users to others
- ✗ Shame or guilt-trip
- ✗ Overpromise results
- ✗ Use jargon without explanation

### Tone by Platform

| Platform | Tone | Content Focus |
|----------|------|---------------|
| **Reddit** | Conversational, authentic, helpful | Community value, genuine tips, story sharing |
| **Instagram** | Visual, aspirational, warm | Heatmap aesthetics, quote cards, feature peeks |
| **X (Twitter)** | Concise, witty, thought-provoking | Quick insights, launch updates, engagement |
| **Email** | Personal, valuable, respectful | Onboarding, feature updates, milestone celebrations |

## Part IV: Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Reddit

**Subreddit Targets:**
- r/selfimprovement
- r/productivity
- r/mentalhealth

- r/getdisciplined

**Content Types:**

1. **Value Posts** (80% of content)
   - Share genuine insights about self-tracking
   - Answer questions with depth
   - Reference Soloist naturally when relevant
   - Never hard-sell

2. **Launch Announcements** (10%)
   - Frame as "built this for myself" story
   - Ask for feedback genuinely

3. **Community Engagement** (10%)
   - Comment helpfully on relevant posts
   - Build relationships before promoting

**Example Reddit Post:**

```markdown
Title: After 6 months of tracking my mood daily, here's what I actually learned

I started logging how I felt each day back in March. Just a simple 0-100 score 
and a few notes. Here's what surprised me:

1. **Mondays aren't actually my worst days.** Wednesdays are. Something about 
   mid-week slump I never noticed before.

2. **Sleep matters more than I thought.** Days after <6 hours of sleep? 
   Average score: 42. Days after 7+? Average: 71.

3. **Exercise isn't magic, but consistency is.** Single workouts didn't 
   move the needle. But 3+ days/week? Visible difference.

I built a little app to help me visualize this (it shows a heatmap like 
GitHub contributions but for mood). Happy to share more about the patterns 
if anyone's curious about self-tracking.

What's surprised you about tracking your own habits?

Your worst days aren't random.

After analyzing thousands of daily mood logs, we found that most people 
have predictable "low days"—but they're rarely when you'd expect.

It's not always Monday. Sometimes it's the day after a big win. 
Sometimes it's the third day of a streak.
