## Architecture Principles Evaluated

### 1. **Modularity**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between modules
- **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused across contexts
- **Testability**: Individual components can be tested in isolation

### 2. **Consistency**
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent file and component naming patterns
- **Directory Structure**: Predictable and logical file organization
- **Code Style**: Uniform formatting and structural patterns
- **Import/Export Patterns**: Consistent module interface definitions
- **Documentation Patterns**: Standardized documentation approaches

### 3. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between presentation, business, and data layers
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Related functionality grouped by business domain
- **UI/Logic Separation**: User interface separate from business logic
- **Data Access Isolation**: Database interactions properly abstracted
- **Configuration Externalization**: Settings and configuration properly isolated

### 4. **Maintainability**
- **Code Readability**: Clear, understandable code structure
- **Documentation Quality**: Adequate inline and external documentation
- **Test Coverage**: Appropriate test coverage for reliability
- **Complexity Management**: Reasonable cyclomatic complexity levels
- **Error Handling**: Proper error management patterns

### 5. **Dependency Management**
- **Appropriate Abstractions**: Proper use of interfaces and abstractions
- **Circular Dependency Avoidance**: No circular import/dependency chains
- **External Dependency Control**: Managed external library dependencies
- **Version Pinning**: Properly versioned dependency specifications
- **Abstraction Layers**: Appropriate abstraction between architectural layers

## Scoring Interpretation

| Score | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 5.0 | **Excellent** | Exemplary organization following all best practices |
| 4.0-4.9 | **Good** | Well-organized with minor areas for improvement |
| 3.0-3.9 | **Fair** | Acceptable structure with several improvement opportunities |
| 2.0-2.9 | **Poor** | Significant organizational issues requiring attention |
| 1.0-1.9 | **Critical** | Major structural problems needing immediate refactoring |

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit Hooks
Add structure validation to your git hooks:

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
pnpm structure
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Structure audit failed. Please address issues before committing."
  exit 1
fi
```

### CI/CD Integration
Include in your continuous integration:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/structure-audit.yml
- name: Run Structure Audit
  run: pnpm structure --json
  
- name: Generate Architecture Diagrams
  run: pnpm structure --mermaid
  
- name: Upload Diagrams
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: architecture-diagrams
    path: app/tests/structure/diagrams/
```

### Regular Monitoring
Schedule regular structure audits:

```bash
# Weekly structure health check
0 0 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && pnpm structure --detailed > structure-report-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

## Conceptual Tests for New Code

Before adding new features or modules, developers should self-assess using these questions:

### Modularity Assessment
1. Can this component be easily moved to a different project?
2. Does this component have a single, well-defined responsibility?
3. Are the component's dependencies minimal and explicit?
4. Can this component be tested in isolation?
5. Does this component expose a clear, stable interface?

### Consistency Check
1. Does the file name follow the established naming convention?
2. Is the file placed in the appropriate directory?
3. Are similar components organized in a similar manner?
4. Do the exports follow the project's export patterns?
5. Are the imports organized consistently?

### Separation Validation
1. Does this file handle only one type of concern?
2. Are UI components separate from business logic?
3. Are data access patterns isolated from presentation logic?
4. Are configuration concerns separated from implementation?
5. Are external dependencies properly abstracted?

### Maintainability Review
1. Is the code easy to understand without extensive comments?
2. Are variable and function names descriptive?
3. Is the code complexity reasonable?
4. Are there appropriate tests for this functionality?
5. Is the documentation adequate?

### Dependency Analysis
1. Are the dependencies necessary and appropriate?
2. Are there any circular dependencies?
3. Are external dependencies properly versioned?
4. Are internal dependencies following proper hierarchies?
5. Could any dependencies be eliminated through better design?

## Best Practices for High Scores
