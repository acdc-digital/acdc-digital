// AGENT TERMINAL INTEGRATION - Enhanced terminal with agent command support
// /Users/matthewsimon/Projects/LifeOS/LifeOS/app/_components/terminal/_components/AgentTerminal.tsx

/**
 * AgentTerminal Component - Future Implementation
 * 
 * This component will provide advanced terminal integration for the agent system,
 * enabling users to execute agent commands directly from the terminal interface.
 * 
 * PLANNED FEATURES:
 * 
 * 1. Command Parsing & Execution
 *    - Parse slash commands (e.g., /instructions, /create-file, /create-project)
 *    - Route commands to appropriate agents via AgentRegistry
 *    - Handle command parameters and natural language input
 *    - Provide command autocomplete and suggestions
 * 
 * 2. Interactive Command Flow
 *    - Multi-step agent workflows with user prompts
 *    - Interactive component rendering (file selectors, project choosers)
 *    - Progress indicators for long-running agent operations
 *    - Error handling and user feedback
 * 
 * 3. Agent Context Integration
 *    - Pass user session and authentication context to agents
 *    - Maintain conversation history for agent context
 *    - Integration with Convex for data persistence
 *    - Real-time updates and notifications
 * 
 * 4. Terminal UI Enhancements
 *    - Toggle between MCP Tools and Agent Tools modes
 *    - Visual indicators for active agents
 *    - Command history with agent operations
 *    - Rich formatting for agent responses
 * 
 * 5. Advanced Agent Features
 *    - Batch operations and command chaining
 *    - Agent workflow templates and presets
 *    - Premium agent feature gating
 *    - Agent performance metrics and analytics
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * 
 * - Will follow strict state management principles (Convex for data, Zustand for UI)
 * - Use custom hooks for Convex integration (no direct queries in components)
 * - Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all agent interactions
 * - Ensure compatibility with existing terminal chat functionality
 * - Design for extensibility with future agent additions
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * 
 * - AgentRegistry: Command routing and execution
 * - AgentStore: UI state and agent activation tracking  
 * - ConvexMutations: Data persistence and real-time updates
 * - Terminal Store: Terminal state management and history
 * - Authentication: User context and session management
 * 
 * This implementation will be developed in a future iteration once the basic
 * agent system is fully tested and validated.
