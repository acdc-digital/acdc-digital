# Instructions Agent Bug Fixes 🐛➡️✅

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Issue 1: Incorrect Topic Parsing**

**Problem**: The agent was including the `/instructions` command in the topic, creating filenames like:

```
-instructions-create-a-new-instruction-that-says-to-always-say--hello-and-welcome-to-the-eac--at-the-beginning-of-every-response--instructions.md
```

**Root Cause**: Topic extraction was taking the entire input including the command.

**Fix**: ✅ Updated topic parsing logic to:

- Remove `/instructions` command prefix
- Clean special characters properly
- Limit filename length to 50 characters
- Use actual instruction content as topic

### **Issue 2: Unwanted Project Creation**

**Problem**: When using the Instructions agent, a new project was being created instead of using the existing Instructions folder.

**Root Cause**: Two issues:

1. Agent result was being sent through `sendMessage()` which triggered MCP intent detection
2. MCP intent detection was too broad and triggered on "create" + "project" in instruction content

**Fix**: ✅

- Changed agent results to use `storeChatMessage()` directly instead of `sendMessage()`
- Enhanced MCP intent detection to exclude instruction/document/file creation
- Added exclusion for agent result messages

### **Issue 3: Incorrect Folder Assignment**

**Problem**: Files were not being created in the correct Instructions folder.

**Root Cause**: Using folder name `'instructions'` instead of folder ID `'instructions-folder'`.

**Fix**: ✅ Updated `createNewFile()` calls to use the correct folder ID: `'instructions-folder'`

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Agent Store (`/store/agents/index.ts`)

```typescript
// Before
const topic = topicMatch?.[1]?.trim() || input;
const filename = `${topic.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, "-")}-instructions.md`;
createNewFile(filename, "markdown", "project", "instructions");

// After
let cleanInput = input.trim();
if (cleanInput.startsWith("/instructions")) {
  cleanInput = cleanInput.replace("/instructions", "").trim();
}
const topic = topicMatch?.[1]?.trim() || cleanInput || "General Instructions";
const cleanTopic = topic.length > 50 ? topic.substring(0, 50) : topic;
const filename = `${cleanTopic
  .toLowerCase()
  .replace(/[^a-z0-9\s]/g, "")
  .replace(/\s+/g, "-")}-instructions.md`;
createNewFile(filename, "markdown", "project", "instructions-folder");
```

### 2. Chat Component (`/app/_components/terminal/_components/chatMessages.tsx`)

```typescript
// Before
const result = await executeAgentTool(
  activeAgentId,
  agentTool.id,
  messageContent,
  convexMutations,
);
await sendMessage(`🤖 Agent Result:\n\n${result}`);

// After
const result = await executeAgentTool(
  activeAgentId,
  agentTool.id,
  messageContent,
  convexMutations,
);
await storeChatMessage({
  role: "assistant",
  content: `🤖 Agent Result:\n\n${result}`,
  sessionId,
});
```

### 3. MCP Intent Detection (`/convex/chatActions.ts`)

```typescript
// Before
if ((msg.includes("create") || msg.includes("new") || msg.includes("make")) &&
    (msg.includes("project"))) {

// After
if ((msg.includes("create") || msg.includes("new") || msg.includes("make")) &&
    (msg.includes("project")) &&
    !msg.includes("instruction") &&
    !msg.includes("document") &&
    !msg.includes("file")) {
```

### 4. Chat Hook (`/lib/hooks/useChat.ts`)

```typescript
// Added storeChatMessage to return value
return {
  messages: messages ?? [],
  isLoading,
  sendMessage,
  sessionId,
  storeChatMessage, // ✅ Added this
};
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### ✅ Correct Usage Flow:

1. User types: `/instructions always say 'hello and welcome to the EAC' at the beginning of every response`
2. Agent creates file: `always-say-hello-and-welcome-to-the-eac-at-the-beginning-of-every-response-instructions.md`
3. File appears in existing Instructions folder (pinned at top)
4. No new project is created
5. Agent result is stored directly to chat without triggering MCP analysis

### ✅ Correct Filename Generation:

- **Input**: `always say 'hello and welcome to the EAC' at the beginning of every response`
- **Clean Topic**: `always say hello and welcome to the EAC at the beginning of every response`
- **Filename**: `always-say-hello-and-welcome-to-the-eac-at-the-beginning-of-every-response-instructions.md`

### ✅ Correct Project Behavior:

- Instructions folder remains pinned at top
- No duplicate projects created
- Files stored in correct database project
- Agent results don't trigger false MCP detection

## Testing Verification

Test the following scenarios:

1. ✅ `/instructions always say welcome` → Creates clean filename, no new project
2. ✅ File appears in Instructions folder (pinned)
3. ✅ No "Project Created Successfully!" message appears
4. ✅ Agent result is displayed correctly without triggering Claude analysis
5. ✅ Instruction content is available for future AI conversations
