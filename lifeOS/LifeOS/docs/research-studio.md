# Research Studio - Enhanced AI Research Assistant

## Overview

Research Studio is a redesigned full-canvas research interface that combines IDE efficiency with newspaper elegance. It replaces the narrow console approach with a beautiful, functional workspace designed for in-depth research and analysis.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **IDE-Inspired Efficiency**
- **Command Palette Style Interface**: Universal keyboard shortcut (⌘K) to focus the search input
- **Keyboard-Centric Design**: Optimized for power users who prefer keyboard navigation
- **Compact Information Density**: Maximum information in minimal space without clutter
- **Professional Dark Theme**: Extended-use friendly with high contrast and subtle interactions

### 2. **Newspaper-Inspired Aesthetics**
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Headlines, subheadings, and body text follow newspaper principles
- **Two-Column Layout**: Main content with sidebar for metadata and references
- **Typography Scale**: Serif fonts for readability, sans-serif for interface elements
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Modular design with consistent alignment and spacing
- **Strategic White Space**: Clean, uncluttered layout that guides the eye

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Multiple View Modes**: Grid and list views for different browsing preferences
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by starred, recent, or custom search terms
- **Star System**: Save and organize important research sessions
- **Detailed Analysis View**: Full-screen research reading experience
- **Source Attribution**: Clear citation tracking with reliability indicators
