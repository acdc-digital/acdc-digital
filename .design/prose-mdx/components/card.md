Horizontal layout
Add the horizontal prop when you want the icon and content to line up on a single row.

Horizontal card

This layout works well when cards appear in a column grid or next to tables.

Custom CTA and arrows
Set the cta text to add a small call to action and control whether an arrow is shown with the arrow prop. Arrows show automatically for external links, so the manual override is useful for internal links or button-less layouts. You can also change the icon color or pass a JSX icon directly if you need more control.

Custom icon color

Icons accept Lucide names as strings or JSX components. Use the color prop to match a brand or category.

Custom column count
Control the number of columns with the columns prop. On narrow viewports, the layout still stacks into a single column.

Two columns

Set columns={2} to force a two-column layout on wider screens.

Responsive stacking

On small screens, the grid collapses to one column automatically.
