Steps
Present sequential flows with numbered or icon badges.
Use steps to present a clear, sequential path. Each item auto-numbers with a CSS counter, so you can drop steps into MDX without worrying about manual numbering.

Map the flow

List the actions a reader should take.
Keep it scannable

Short titles and concise copy make the sequence easy to follow.

Publish

Ship once the flow feels solid.

Title sizing
Set titleSize on the parent Steps component to apply a font size across all step titles: base, or any heading level (h1–h6). Badges and connectors resize automatically so alignment stays intact.

Large titles

Pair big text with short copy.
Use sparingly

Great for hero sections or key flows.

Icons
Swap the badge number for an icon by passing a Lucide name string or a custom icon component. Numbering still respects order, so you can mix and match.

Pick an icon

Use a Lucide name as a string.
Fit the context

Icons use the same accent badge and spacing.

Ship it

Keep every step consistent.
