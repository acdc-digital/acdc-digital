# 💾 Hi there! I'm Matthew! 

<h4>👋    Hi, I am the founder of: @acdc-digital</h4>


ACDC.digital is a start-up primarily focused on using data to improve patient relations between the Public and Private citizen classes. As Healthare continues to lag in development behind the privare sectors, our aim is to develop private/ secure/ and innovative applications which can increase the speed of attaining important medical information, as well as increase levels of understanding surrounding:

1. Diagnosis 
2. Translation to Generic medical terms
3. Complex and ongoing illness
4. Reductions in patient wait-times or follow-up hospital visits
5. 

Currently, I'm working on a NLP application called Medex. The intent for Medex is: 

> Medex is an evolutionary chat application, where users upload their medical information into the app, and then they can conversationally chat against their own data to understand it better. Then they can choose which information they want to share with others, which will allow others to chat against their data or comments. All without communication between either group. This helps the people, and supporting community to create a universal understanding of complex diagnosis in a way their support network will actually know how to help.


I have a lot of content out there, particularly on NLP and Semantic Search. Here are a few of the coolest things that I'm most proud of:
