My developer journey started when my son was born with a rare terminall illness. I was determined that with AI I could help organize his life, uncover medical insights, and develop solutions that could help families like mine. This project was initially titled, "Medex" shortform for Medical Executive Assistant, which is an AI personality that can use techniques such as RAG (retrieval generated augmentation) allowing Users to upload their medical documents, and the assistant will be able to organize the information in a more usable format. This journey has had many successes, albeit only a limited working demo to date. Instead, the short-term focus of this project has been developing the Pipeline- which now takes the name of 'Solomon'. Solomon is ACDC.digital's first AI personality, and the backbone in our development of natural language pipelines, agent tasks, and workstation-UI. Solomon is spread thin, being used as the integral cetnre-piece of ACDC.digital, in order to bring systems and programs to life. 

<h2>Project Highlights:</h2>
<h3>ðŸ©» Medex: Revolutionizing Healthcare Communications ðŸ©»</h3>

My goal is to transform the way we understand and communicate with our health information. The mission is simple, yet profound: To empower patients and their families with a clear understanding of their health records, bridging the gap between complex medical jargon and everyday languages.

Medex was the inspiration for ACDC.digital. It's was determined to be a revolutionary chat application where users can upload their medical information and then chat conversationally with their data in order to understand it better. Medex uses proprietary models for text splitting, embeddings, and vector store & retrieval, utilizing the latest technologies for each component of the software. But Medex is more than just a chat application. It's a tool that allows patients to take control of their health information. They can choose which information they want to share with others, allowing their support network to understand their health status without any direct communication. This creates a universal understanding of complex diagnoses, empowering the patient's support network to provide the best possible care. 

Today, Medex has taken a backseat, as our next frontier Front-End Workstation applications (Solomon Desktop Prototype & Solomon Desktop Application) are paving the way for interactive user alignment. I believe this significantly enhance the original mission, by combining the capability of LLMs to organize complex information, with modern UI design that allows for simple modulation of complex and unstructured data. Our objective is to simplify complex data in order to uncover insights that may not have been easily discoverable before - making information available to a wider audience through a broader delivery system that can be personalized to the individual User.
