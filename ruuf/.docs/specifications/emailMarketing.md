# Email Marketing System Implementation Guide

## Overview for AI Implementation

This document serves as a comprehensive implementation guide for building an intelligent email marketing system using NextJS, TypeScript, Convex, and AI agent capabilities. This guide is specifically structured for Claude Sonnet 4 and GitHub Copilot implementation assistance.

## 1. System Requirements and Context

### Primary Objectives
Build a sophisticated email workflow system that combines modern web technologies with AI-powered assistance to solve common email marketing challenges:

- **Real-time Campaign Management**: Create, monitor, and optimize email campaigns with live status updates
- **Intelligent Automation**: AI agent that proactively monitors, troubleshoots, and optimizes campaigns  
- **Scalable Email Delivery**: Handle large recipient lists (1,400+ emails) efficiently with proper queuing and batching
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Track delivery status, bounces, spam complaints, and performance metrics
- **Smart Error Handling**: Automated detection and resolution of delivery issues

### Target Users
Marketing teams, communication specialists, and CRM managers who need to send bulk emails but may lack deep technical expertise in backend systems.

### Core Problems Being Solved
- Lack of real-time visibility into email delivery status
- Manual error handling and troubleshooting processes  
- Inefficient workflows for campaign management
- Difficulty scaling email delivery infrastructure
- Absence of proactive monitoring and intelligent recommendations

### 1.3. User Journeys and Interactions

#### 1.3.1. Initiating an Email Campaign

**Scenario:** A marketing manager wants to send a new product announcement to 1,400 subscribers.

**Interaction:**

1.  The user navigates to the email campaign creation section within the application.
2.  They upload or select the list of 1,400 recipient email addresses.
3.  The user composes the email content, including subject, sender details (e.g., "Me <test@mydomain.com>"), and the HTML body (potentially using a rich text editor or by selecting a pre-designed template).
4.  They specify any advanced options, such as `replyTo` addresses or custom headers.
5.  The user initiates the email sending process.

**Desired Outcome:** The system acknowledges the request, confirms that the email campaign has been queued for sending, and provides an initial status indicating that the process has begun.

#### 1.3.2. Monitoring Email Delivery Status

**Scenario:** The marketing manager wants to track the progress of the ongoing product announcement campaign.

**Interaction:**

1.  The user accesses a dashboard or a dedicated 


email campaign status page.
2.  They view real-time updates on the number of emails sent, delivered, bounced, or marked as spam.
3.  The system provides a visual representation (e.g., progress bar, charts) of the campaign's status.
4.  The user can drill down into specific email statuses to see details, such as the reason for a bounce or the recipient's email address.

**Desired Outcome:** The user has clear, real-time visibility into the email campaign's performance, allowing them to quickly identify and understand any issues.

#### 1.3.3. Receiving Proactive Notifications and Error Handling

**Scenario:** An issue arises during the email sending process, such as a high bounce rate or an API rate limit being hit.

**Interaction:**

1.  The backend agent detects the anomaly (e.g., a sudden spike in bounced emails, a Resend API rate limit error).
2.  The system immediately sends a notification to the user (e.g., in-app alert, email, or push notification, depending on user preferences).
3.  The notification clearly states the problem, its potential impact, and suggests actionable steps (e.g., "High bounce rate detected for Campaign X. Consider reviewing your recipient list for invalid addresses.", "Resend API rate limit reached. Sending will resume automatically when the limit resets.").
4.  For critical errors, the agent might offer to pause the campaign or provide options for remediation.

**Desired Outcome:** The user is proactively informed of issues, understands the nature of the problem, and receives guidance on how to resolve it, minimizing manual intervention and potential negative impacts on campaign performance.

#### 1.3.4. Agent-Assisted Workflow and Optimization

**Scenario:** The user wants to optimize their email sending strategy or troubleshoot a persistent delivery issue.

**Interaction:**

1.  The user interacts with the backend agent through a chat interface or a dedicated 


agent console.
2.  They can ask questions like, "Why are my emails bouncing?" or "How can I improve my email delivery rate?"
3.  The agent analyzes historical data, identifies patterns, and provides personalized recommendations (e.g., "Your emails to domain X have a high bounce rate; consider segmenting your list," or "Implementing DMARC records could improve deliverability.").
4.  The agent can also suggest automated tasks, such as cleaning up old email records or scheduling regular email health checks.

**Desired Outcome:** The user leverages the agent's intelligence to optimize their email campaigns, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and continuously improve their email sending practices.

### 1.4. What Success Looks Like

Success for this system is defined by the following:

*   **High Email Deliverability:** A significant reduction in bounced emails and spam complaints, leading to a higher percentage of emails reaching their intended recipients.
*   **Efficient Campaign Management:** Users can initiate, monitor, and manage large email campaigns with minimal manual effort and time.
*   **Proactive Problem Resolution:** Issues are identified and communicated to the user promptly, with clear guidance for resolution, reducing downtime and negative impact.
*   **Empowered Users:** Users feel confident and in control of their email sending processes, with the agent acting as a helpful assistant rather than a black box.
*   **Scalability and Reliability:** The system can handle a growing volume of emails and users without performance degradation or service interruptions.

### 1.5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To measure the success of the system, the following KPIs will be tracked:

*   **Email Delivery Rate:** Percentage of emails successfully delivered to recipients.
*   **Bounce Rate:** Percentage of emails that could not be delivered.
*   **Spam Complaint Rate:** Percentage of emails marked as spam by recipients.
*   **User Satisfaction:** Measured through feedback mechanisms and surveys regarding the ease of use and effectiveness of the system.
*   **Time to Resolution (for issues):** The average time taken from an issue being detected to its resolution.
*   **Agent Interaction Rate:** Frequency of user interaction with the backend agent for insights and assistance.
*   **Email Processing Throughput:** Number of emails processed per unit of time.

This concludes the User Experience Specification. The next section will delve into the technical architecture plan, outlining the components and their interactions to achieve the described user experience.



## 2. Technical Architecture Plan

This section provides a comprehensive technical plan for implementing the email workflow system with Resend integration and agentic backend capabilities. The architecture leverages the specified technology stack: NextJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Convex database, and shadcn/ui components, while incorporating the Convex Resend component and Agent component for enhanced functionality.

### 2.1. System Architecture Overview

The system follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns between the frontend presentation layer, backend business logic, and data persistence layer. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and resilient, with built-in support for real-time updates and asynchronous processing.

#### 2.1.1. High-Level Architecture Components

The system consists of the following primary components:

**Frontend Layer (NextJS + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui):**
The frontend serves as the user interface, providing an intuitive dashboard for email campaign management, real-time status monitoring, and agent interaction. It communicates with the Convex backend through reactive queries and mutations, ensuring real-time updates without requiring manual page refreshes.

**Backend Layer (Convex Functions):**
The backend is implemented using Convex functions, which provide serverless execution with built-in reactivity and persistence. This layer includes queries for data retrieval, mutations for data modification, and actions for external API interactions and complex business logic.

**Email Processing Layer (Convex Resend Component):**
The email processing is handled by the official Convex Resend component, which provides queuing, batching, rate limiting, and durable execution for email delivery. This component ensures reliable email delivery even in the face of temporary failures or network outages.

**Agent Layer (Convex Agent Component):**
The intelligent agent functionality is implemented using the Convex Agent component, which manages conversation threads, provides contextual assistance, and enables sophisticated workflow automation with persistent memory.

**Data Layer (Convex Database):**
All application data is stored in Convex's built-in database, which provides ACID transactions, real-time reactivity, and automatic scaling. The database stores email campaigns, recipient lists, delivery status, agent conversations, and system configuration.

#### 2.1.2. Technology Stack Justification

The chosen technology stack provides several advantages for this use case:

**NextJS with TypeScript** offers excellent developer experience with strong typing, server-side rendering capabilities, and built-in optimization features. The framework's file-based routing and API routes provide a clean structure for the frontend application.

**TailwindCSS** enables rapid UI development with utility-first CSS classes, ensuring consistent styling and responsive design across all components. Its integration with shadcn/ui components provides a professional, accessible design system.

**Convex Database** eliminates the need for separate database management while providing real-time reactivity, which is crucial for live email campaign monitoring. The serverless nature reduces operational overhead and provides automatic scaling.

**Convex Components** (Resend and Agent) provide battle-tested implementations of complex functionality, reducing development time and ensuring reliability through proven patterns and error handling.

### 2.2. Data Model and Schema Design

The data model is designed to support the core functionality while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements. The schema leverages Convex's document-based storage with strong typing through TypeScript.

#### 2.2.1. Core Data Entities

**Email Campaigns Table:**
```typescript
campaigns: defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  description: v.optional(v.string()),
  status: v.union(v.literal("draft"), v.literal("queued"), v.literal("sending"), v.literal("completed"), v.literal("paused"), v.literal("failed")),
  fromAddress: v.string(),
  replyToAddress: v.optional(v.string()),
  subject: v.string(),
  htmlContent: v.string(),
  plainTextContent: v.optional(v.string()),
  recipientListId: v.id("recipientLists"),
  createdBy: v.id("users"),
  createdAt: v.number(),
  scheduledAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  completedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  totalRecipients: v.number(),
  sentCount: v.number(),
  deliveredCount: v.number(),
  bouncedCount: v.number(),
  spamCount: v.number(),
  failedCount: v.number(),
  customHeaders: v.optional(v.array(v.object({
    name: v.string(),
    value: v.string()
  })))
})
```

**Recipient Lists Table:**
```typescript
recipientLists: defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  description: v.optional(v.string()),
  createdBy: v.id("users"),
  createdAt: v.number(),
  totalRecipients: v.number(),
  activeRecipients: v.number(),
  tags: v.optional(v.array(v.string()))
})
```

**Recipients Table:**
```typescript
recipients: defineTable({
  email: v.string(),
  firstName: v.optional(v.string()),
  lastName: v.optional(v.string()),
  listId: v.id("recipientLists"),
  status: v.union(v.literal("active"), v.literal("unsubscribed"), v.literal("bounced"), v.literal("invalid")),
  addedAt: v.number(),
  lastEmailSent: v.optional(v.number()),
  bounceCount: v.number(),
  customFields: v.optional(v.record(v.string(), v.any()))
}).index("by_list", ["listId"]).index("by_email", ["email"])
```

**Email Delivery Records Table:**
```typescript
emailDeliveries: defineTable({
  campaignId: v.id("campaigns"),
  recipientId: v.id("recipients"),
  resendEmailId: v.string(), // ID from Resend component
  status: v.union(v.literal("queued"), v.literal("sent"), v.literal("delivered"), v.literal("bounced"), v.literal("complained"), v.literal("failed")),
  sentAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  deliveredAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  bouncedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  bounceReason: v.optional(v.string()),
  complaintAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  failureReason: v.optional(v.string()),
  retryCount: v.number(),
  lastRetryAt: v.optional(v.number())
}).index("by_campaign", ["campaignId"]).index("by_recipient", ["recipientId"]).index("by_status", ["status"])
```

#### 2.2.2. Agent and Workflow Data

The agent functionality requires additional tables to store conversation history and workflow state:

**Agent Threads Table (managed by Agent component):**
The Convex Agent component automatically manages thread storage, but we'll extend it with campaign-specific context:

```typescript
campaignThreads: defineTable({
  campaignId: v.id("campaigns"),
  agentThreadId: v.string(), // Reference to Agent component thread
  userId: v.id("users"),
  purpose: v.union(v.literal("monitoring"), v.literal("troubleshooting"), v.literal("optimization")),
  createdAt: v.number(),
  lastActivityAt: v.number(),
  isActive: v.boolean()
}).index("by_campaign", ["campaignId"]).index("by_user", ["userId"])
```

**System Alerts Table:**
```typescript
systemAlerts: defineTable({
  campaignId: v.optional(v.id("campaigns")),
  alertType: v.union(v.literal("high_bounce_rate"), v.literal("rate_limit"), v.literal("delivery_failure"), v.literal("spam_complaint")),
  severity: v.union(v.literal("info"), v.literal("warning"), v.literal("error"), v.literal("critical")),
  title: v.string(),
  message: v.string(),
  actionRequired: v.boolean(),
  suggestedActions: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
  createdAt: v.number(),
  acknowledgedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  acknowledgedBy: v.optional(v.id("users")),
  resolvedAt: v.optional(v.number()),
  metadata: v.optional(v.record(v.string(), v.any()))
}).index("by_campaign", ["campaignId"]).index("by_severity", ["severity"]).index("by_created", ["createdAt"])
```

### 2.3. Backend Implementation Architecture

The backend implementation leverages Convex's serverless function model with clear separation between queries, mutations, and actions. The architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and maintainability through well-defined interfaces and error handling patterns.

#### 2.3.1. Convex Function Organization

**Query Functions (convex/queries/):**
Query functions handle all read operations and provide real-time reactivity to the frontend. They are organized by domain:

- `campaigns.ts`: Campaign listing, details, and statistics
- `recipients.ts`: Recipient management and list operations  
- `deliveries.ts`: Email delivery status and analytics
- `alerts.ts`: System alert retrieval and filtering
- `dashboard.ts`: Aggregated dashboard data and metrics

**Mutation Functions (convex/mutations/):**
Mutation functions handle data modifications with proper validation and error handling:

- `campaigns.ts`: Campaign creation, updates, and status changes
- `recipients.ts`: Recipient list management and individual recipient operations
- `alerts.ts`: Alert acknowledgment and resolution
- `settings.ts`: User preferences and system configuration

**Action Functions (convex/actions/):**
Action functions handle external API interactions and complex business logic:

- `emailSending.ts`: Email campaign execution using Resend component
- `agentWorkflows.ts`: Agent-driven workflow automation
- `webhookHandlers.ts`: Resend webhook processing
- `analytics.ts`: Advanced analytics and reporting
- `maintenance.ts`: System maintenance and cleanup tasks

#### 2.3.2. Resend Component Integration

The Resend component integration follows the established patterns from the documentation while adding campaign-specific functionality:

```typescript
// convex/lib/resend.ts
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { Resend } from "@convex-dev/resend";

export const resend = new Resend(components.resend, {
  testMode: false, // Set to true for development
  onEmailEvent: internal.webhooks.handleResendEvent,
});
```

**Email Sending Action:**
```typescript
// convex/actions/emailSending.ts
export const sendCampaignEmails = action({
  args: {
    campaignId: v.id("campaigns"),
    batchSize: v.optional(v.number())
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { campaignId, batchSize = 100 }) => {
    const campaign = await ctx.runQuery(api.campaigns.getCampaign, { campaignId });
    const recipients = await ctx.runQuery(api.recipients.getActiveRecipients, { 
      listId: campaign.recipientListId 
    });
    
    // Process recipients in batches
    for (let i = 0; i < recipients.length; i += batchSize) {
      const batch = recipients.slice(i, i + batchSize);
      await processBatch(ctx, campaign, batch);
    }
  }
});

async function processBatch(ctx: ActionCtx, campaign: Campaign, recipients: Recipient[]) {
  for (const recipient of recipients) {
    try {
      const emailId = await resend.sendEmail(ctx, {
        from: campaign.fromAddress,
        to: recipient.email,
        subject: campaign.subject,
        html: personalizeContent(campaign.htmlContent, recipient),
        replyTo: campaign.replyToAddress,
        headers: campaign.customHeaders
      });
      
      // Record the email delivery attempt
      await ctx.runMutation(api.deliveries.recordEmailSent, {
        campaignId: campaign._id,
        recipientId: recipient._id,
        resendEmailId: emailId,
        sentAt: Date.now()
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle individual email failures
      await ctx.runMutation(api.deliveries.recordEmailFailed, {
        campaignId: campaign._id,
        recipientId: recipient._id,
        failureReason: error.message,
        failedAt: Date.now()
      });
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2.3.3. Agent Component Integration

The Agent component provides intelligent assistance and workflow automation:

```typescript
// convex/lib/agent.ts
import { Agent } from "@convex-dev/agents";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

export const emailWorkflowAgent = new Agent(components.agent, {
  name: "Email Workflow Assistant",
  chat: openai.chat("gpt-4o-mini"),
  textEmbedding: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  instructions: `You are an email marketing assistant specializing in campaign optimization, 
    deliverability troubleshooting, and workflow automation. You have access to campaign 
    analytics, delivery statistics, and can provide actionable recommendations for improving 
    email performance.`,
  tools: {
    getCampaignAnalytics,
    getDeliveryStatistics,
    analyzeBouncedEmails,
    suggestListCleaning,
    scheduleMaintenanceTasks
  }
});
```

**Agent Tools Implementation:**
```typescript
// convex/lib/agentTools.ts
export const getCampaignAnalytics = createTool({
  description: "Retrieve comprehensive analytics for a specific email campaign",
  args: z.object({ 
    campaignId: z.string().describe("The campaign ID to analyze") 
  }),
  handler: async (ctx, { campaignId }): Promise<CampaignAnalytics> => {
    return ctx.runQuery(api.analytics.getCampaignAnalytics, { 
      campaignId: campaignId as Id<"campaigns"> 
    });
  }
});

export const analyzeBouncedEmails = createTool({
  description: "Analyze bounced emails to identify patterns and suggest improvements",
  args: z.object({ 
    campaignId: z.string().describe("The campaign ID to analyze bounces for") 
  }),
  handler: async (ctx, { campaignId }): Promise<BounceAnalysis> => {
    const bounces = await ctx.runQuery(api.deliveries.getBouncedEmails, { 
      campaignId: campaignId as Id<"campaigns"> 
    });
    
    // Analyze bounce reasons and patterns
    const analysis = analyzeBouncePatterns(bounces);
    return analysis;
  }
});
```

### 2.4. Frontend Implementation Architecture

The frontend implementation leverages NextJS with TypeScript for a robust, type-safe user interface. The architecture emphasizes component reusability, real-time data synchronization, and responsive design principles.

#### 2.4.2. State Management and Real-time Updates

The application leverages Convex's built-in reactivity for state management, eliminating the need for complex state management libraries:

```typescript
// hooks/useCampaigns.ts
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

export function useCampaigns() {
  const campaigns = useQuery(api.campaigns.listCampaigns);
  const isLoading = campaigns === undefined;
  
  return {
    campaigns: campaigns || [],
    isLoading,
    error: null // Convex handles errors automatically
  };
}

// hooks/useCampaignDetails.ts
export function useCampaignDetails(campaignId: string) {
  const campaign = useQuery(api.campaigns.getCampaign, { campaignId });
  const deliveryStats = useQuery(api.deliveries.getCampaignStats, { campaignId });
  const recentAlerts = useQuery(api.alerts.getCampaignAlerts, { campaignId });
  
  return {
    campaign,
    deliveryStats,
    recentAlerts,
    isLoading: campaign === undefined || deliveryStats === undefined
  };
}
```

#### 2.4.3. User Interface Components

**Campaign Dashboard Component:**
```typescript
// components/campaigns/CampaignDashboard.tsx
import { useCampaigns } from "../../hooks/useCampaigns";
import { CampaignCard } from "./CampaignCard";
import { Button } from "../ui/button";
import { Plus } from "lucide-react";

export function CampaignDashboard() {
  const { campaigns, isLoading } = useCampaigns();
  
  if (isLoading) {
    return <CampaignSkeleton />;
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Email Campaigns</h1>
        <Button asChild>
          <Link href="/campaigns/create">
            <Plus className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
            New Campaign
          </Link>
        </Button>
      </div>
      
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
        {campaigns.map((campaign) => (
          <CampaignCard key={campaign._id} campaign={campaign} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Real-time Status Component:**
```typescript
// components/campaigns/CampaignStatus.tsx
export function CampaignStatus({ campaignId }: { campaignId: string }) {
  const { deliv


eryStats } = useCampaignDetails(campaignId);
  
  if (!deliveryStats) return <Skeleton className="h-32" />;
  
  const progressPercentage = (deliveryStats.sentCount / deliveryStats.totalRecipients) * 100;
  
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Delivery Progress</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <Progress value={progressPercentage} className="h-2" />
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4 text-sm">
            <div className="text-center">
              <div className="font-semibold text-blue-600">{deliveryStats.sentCount}</div>
              <div className="text-gray-500">Sent</div>
            </div>
            <div className="text-center">
              <div className="font-semibold text-green-600">{deliveryStats.deliveredCount}</div>
              <div className="text-gray-500">Delivered</div>
            </div>
            <div className="text-center">
              <div className="font-semibold text-red-600">{deliveryStats.bouncedCount}</div>
              <div className="text-gray-500">Bounced</div>
            </div>
            <div className="text-center">
              <div className="font-semibold text-yellow-600">{deliveryStats.spamCount}</div>
              <div className="text-gray-500">Spam</div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### 2.5. Integration Patterns and API Design

The system follows established patterns for integrating with external services while maintaining reliability and error handling.

#### 2.5.1. Webhook Integration

**Resend Webhook Handler:**
```typescript
// convex/http.ts
import { httpRouter } from "convex/server";
import { httpAction } from "./_generated/server";
import { resend } from "./lib/resend";

const http = httpRouter();

http.route({
  path: "/resend-webhook",
  method: "POST",
  handler: httpAction(async (ctx, req) => {
    return await resend.handleResendEventWebhook(ctx, req);
  }),
});

export default http;
```

**Event Processing:**
```typescript
// convex/webhooks/resendEvents.ts
export const handleResendEvent = internalMutation({
  args: vOnEmailEventArgs,
  handler: async (ctx, { id: emailId, event }) => {
    // Update delivery record based on event type
    const deliveryRecord = await ctx.db
      .query("emailDeliveries")
      .withIndex("by_resend_id", (q) => q.eq("resendEmailId", emailId))
      .first();
    
    if (!deliveryRecord) {
      console.warn(`Delivery record not found for email ID: ${emailId}`);
      return;
    }
    
    switch (event.type) {
      case "email.delivered":
        await ctx.db.patch(deliveryRecord._id, {
          status: "delivered",
          deliveredAt: event.created_at
        });
        break;
        
      case "email.bounced":
        await ctx.db.patch(deliveryRecord._id, {
          status: "bounced",
          bouncedAt: event.created_at,
          bounceReason: event.data.reason
        });
        
        // Trigger agent analysis for high bounce rates
        await checkBounceRateThreshold(ctx, deliveryRecord.campaignId);
        break;
        
      case "email.complained":
        await ctx.db.patch(deliveryRecord._id, {

export async function requireCampaignAccess(
  ctx: QueryCtx | MutationCtx, 
  campaignId: Id<"campaigns">
) {
  const identity = await requireAuth(ctx);
  const campaign = await ctx.db.get(campaignId);
  
  if (!campaign || campaign.createdBy !== identity.subject) {
    throw new Error("Access denied");
  }
  
  return campaign;
}
```

#### 2.6.2. Compliance Features

**Unsubscribe Management:**
```typescript
// convex/mutations/unsubscribe.ts
export const processUnsubscribe = mutation({
  args: { 
    email: v.string(),
    campaignId: v.optional(v.id("campaigns")),
    reason: v.optional(v.string())
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { email, campaignId, reason }) => {
    // Update recipient status across all lists
    const recipients = await ctx.db
      .query("recipients")
      .withIndex("by_email", (q) => q.eq("email", email))
      .collect();
    
    for (const recipient of recipients) {
      await ctx.db.patch(recipient._id, {
        status: "unsubscribed",
        unsubscribedAt: Date.now(),
        unsubscribeReason: reason
      });
    }
    
    // Log unsubscribe event
    await ctx.db.insert("unsubscribeEvents", {
      email,
      campaignId,
      reason,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      ipAddress: ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()?.tokenIdentifier // If available
    });
  }
});
```

**Bounce Handling:**
```typescript
// convex/lib/bounceHandler.ts
export async function handleBounce(
  ctx: MutationCtx,
  deliveryRecord: Doc<"emailDeliveries">,
  bounceType: "hard" | "soft",
  reason: string
) {
  const recipient = await ctx.db.get(deliveryRecord.recipientId);
  if (!recipient) return;
  
  if (bounceType === "hard") {
    // Mark recipient as invalid for hard bounces
    await ctx.db.patch(recipient._id, {
      status: "invalid",
      bounceCount: recipient.bounceCount + 1,
      lastBounceAt: Date.now(),
      lastBounceReason: reason
    });
  } else {
    // Increment bounce count for soft bounces
    const newBounceCount = recipient.bounceCount + 1;
    await ctx.db.patch(recipient._id, {
      bounceCount: newBounceCount,
      lastBounceAt: Date.now(),
      lastBounceReason: reason
    });
    
    // Mark as invalid if soft bounce threshold exceeded
    if (newBounceCount >= 5) {
      await ctx.db.patch(recipient._id, {
        status: "invalid"
      });
    }
  }
}
```

  async processCampaign(ctx: ActionCtx, campaignId: Id<"campaigns">) {
    const campaign = await ctx.runQuery(api.campaigns.getCampaign, { campaignId });
    const recipients = await ctx.runQuery(api.recipients.getActiveRecipients, {
      listId: campaign.recipientListId
    });
    
    // Split recipients into batches
    const batches = this.createBatches(recipients, this.BATCH_SIZE);
    
    // Process batches with concurrency control
    for (let i = 0; i < batches.length; i += this.CONCURRENT_BATCHES) {
      const concurrentBatches = batches.slice(i, i + this.CONCURRENT_BATCHES);
      
      await Promise.all(
        concurrentBatches.map(batch => this.processBatch(ctx, campaign, batch))
      );
      
      // Rate limiting delay
      if (i + this.CONCURRENT_BATCHES < batches.length) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, this.RATE_LIMIT_DELAY));
      }
    }
  }
  
  private createBatches<T>(items: T[], batchSize: number): T[][] {
    const batches: T[][] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += batchSize) {
      batches.push(items.slice(i, i + batchSize));
    }
    return batches;
  }
}
```

#### 2.7.2. Database Optimization

**Indexing Strategy:**
The database schema includes strategic indexes for common query patterns:
- Campaign queries by user and status
- Recipient queries by list and email
- Delivery record queries by campaign and status
- Alert queries by severity and timestamp

**Query Optimization:**
```typescript
// convex/queries/optimizedQueries.ts
export const getCampaignMetrics = query({
  args: { campaignId: v.id("campaigns") },
  handler: async (ctx, { campaignId }) => {
    // Single query with aggregation instead of multiple queries
    const deliveries = await ctx.db
      .query("emailDeliveries")
      .withIndex("by_campaign", (q) => q.eq("campaignId", campaignId))
      .collect();
    
    // Aggregate in memory for better performance
    const metrics = deliveries.reduce((acc, delivery) => {
      acc.total++;
      acc[delivery.status]++;
      return acc;
    }, {
      total: 0,
      queued: 0,
      sent: 0,
      delivered: 0,
      bounced: 0,
      complained: 0,
      failed: 0
    });
    
    return metrics;
  }
});
```

### 2.8. Monitoring and Observability

The system includes comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to ensure operational excellence and rapid issue resolution.

  method: "GET",
  handler: httpAction(async (ctx, req) => {
    const systemHealth = await checkSystemHealth(ctx);
    
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({
      status: systemHealth.overall,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      components: systemHealth.components
    }), {
      status: systemHealth.overall === "healthy" ? 200 : 503,
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
    });
  })
});

async function checkSystemHealth(ctx: ActionCtx) {
  const checks = await Promise.allSettled([
    checkDatabaseHealth(ctx),
    checkResendHealth(ctx),
    checkAgentHealth(ctx)
  ]);
  
  const components = checks.map((check, index) => ({
    name: ["database", "resend", "agent"][index],
    status: check.status === "fulfilled" ? "healthy" : "unhealthy",
    error: check.status === "rejected" ? check.reason.message : null
  }));
  
  const overall = components.every(c => c.status === "healthy") ? "healthy" : "unhealthy";
  
  return { overall, components };
}
```

#### 2.8.2. Performance Metrics

**Campaign Performance Tracking:**
```typescript
// convex/lib/metrics.ts
export const trackCampaignMetrics = internalMutation({
  args: {
    campaignId: v.id("campaigns"),
    metricType: v.string(),
    value: v.number(),
    metadata: v.optional(v.any())
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { campaignId, metricType, value, metadata }) => {
    await ctx.db.insert("performanceMetrics", {
      campaignId,
      metricType,
      value,
      metadata,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
  }
});

// Usage in email sending action
await ctx.runMutation(internal.metrics.trackCampaignMetrics, {
  campaignId,
  metricType: "batch_processing_time",
  value: processingTime,
  metadata: { batchSize, recipientCount }
});
