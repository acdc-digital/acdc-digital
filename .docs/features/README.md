## Feature Overview

### Reddit Simulator

**Status**: üìÑ Documented (Implementation Pending)

**Purpose**: Uses historical data patterns to predict post engagement and recommend optimal posting strategies.

**Key Capabilities**:
- ‚è∞ **Temporal Analysis**: Identifies best posting times per subreddit
- üîç **Pattern Matching**: Finds similar successful posts in history
- üé≤ **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Predicts performance with confidence intervals
- üéØ **Smart Recommendations**: Ranks strategies by predicted success

**Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Generator/Network tab features

**Data Sources**: Leverages 5 existing data tables (no new data collection needed)

**Implementation Timeline**: 8 weeks across 4 phases

## Documentation Standards

All feature documentation in this directory follows these standards:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Architecture, implementation, and usage
2. **Visual Aids**: ASCII diagrams, mockups, and flowcharts
3. **Code Examples**: TypeScript interfaces and function signatures
4. **Implementation Plans**: Phased approach with checklists
5. **Integration Details**: How it fits with existing systems
